# Perspret

Perspret is game / game engine, developed in competition on portal [ict.social]("https://www.ict.social/") respectively [ITnetwork.cz]("https://www.itnetwork.cz").

The game contains few levels and you can see live demo here: [https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/Perspret/]("https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/Perspret/").

Because of time, I could't fully finish the game. I have a lot of ideas, what to add or how to improve the engine respectively the game.
Unfortunately, I don't have time for that, so there is no active development.

The game is written in TypeScript and uses 2D Canvas rendering.
